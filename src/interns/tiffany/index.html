        <p>
          Nice to meet you, I'm Tiffany! I'm a gal that loves to learn, challenge myself, and step out of my comfort
          zone. I didn't feel like I could do that in my previous field, biology, in fact I aced my way throughout
          college. I knew if I were to pursue software
          engineering I would be able to apply myself and learn new things my entire career, and that's challenge I gladly accept!
          Additionally, I absolutely LOVE how I can incorporate my passion for art and design with programming.
          <span>In fact, all the images you see on this page were designed by me (of course with inspiration from Lob's own
          lobster) and I had a blast doing so!</span>
        </p>

        <p>
          I'm excited to apply for a software engineering internship at Lob and would love the chance to collaborate
          with the innovative problem solvers there. On the frontend, I would love to take part in both design and engineering -- that includes
          helping create wireframes and mockups to create beautiful, intuitive, user friendly interfaces and using my technical skills to actually
          code it out. In particular, I would like to create highly dynamic, interactive pages to expand my knowledge of React.
        </p>
        
        <p>
          On the backend, I would like to learn more about Lob's APIs and how to create scalable systems that can accomodate a lot of requests at
          once. Most of the projects I've made are small, so I didn't feel the need to scale them but doing so would be
          a great learning experience and allow me to understand real world applications. I'm looking forward to hearing back from Lob!
